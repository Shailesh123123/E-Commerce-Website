# E-Commerce-Website
angular js/Spring MVC project

What does this application do:

Its an E-Commerce website that allows you to buy commodities online only if you logged in as a customer, even though he can view the product catalog without logging in(per se cannot buy), a customer can add the products on the basis of the category he chooses and add it onto the cart and buy them once he has logged into the website.

An admin can add new sellers and can view the list of customers and sellers.He can additionally also enable or disable a seller.

Seller can add new products to the catalog and view the list of customers who brought these products so that he can have a list of target customers.

# STEPS TO RUN THIS APPLICATION:

1)On your specified port(specifically mine is localhost:8080), launch the application.

2)Using AJAX, i have made sure that on loading dynamically a get request is made to get a list of all the products from the back end so that a list of all the products can be displayed on the home page.

3)A customer can log in now/ if he has no credentials he needs to register as a customer to buy a product(add to cart, checkout and buy).

4)This application has multiple logins that involve both seller and admin, whose functionalities have been mentioned above.
